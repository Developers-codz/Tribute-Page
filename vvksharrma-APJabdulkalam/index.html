                <ul class="points">
                    <li>Born on October 15, 1931, Kalam came from a humble background. He sold newspapers to support his family financially when he was a kid.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam is known as the father of Indian Missile Technology and has played a prominent role in India’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests.</li>
                    <li>He brought dignity to whatever he did. Even Politics!</li>
                    <li>Before becoming the president, Dr. Kalam worked as an Aerospace Engineer with DRDO and ISRO. He was called the “Missile Man” of India.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam was much more than a political figure. He was a scientist, writer, inspirational speaker and motivational figure.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam’s infectious personality had not just inspired Indians but also people across the globe.</li>
                    <li>Kalam was nominated for Youth Icon of the Year award by MTV in 2003 and 2006. His age was 73 and 76 respectively then.</li>
                    <li>In 1998, he along with cardiologist Dr Soma Raju developed a low-cost coronary stent. It was later named ‘Kalam-Raju Stent’ in their honour.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam had received several awards and recognition for his extra ordinary contribution to scientific research and modernization of defense technology in India.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam was a great colleague too and went an extra mile for his co-workers.</li>
                    <li>When Dr. Kalam first moved to Rashtrapati Bhawan, he asked all luxurious rooms to be locked up as he didn’t want to use them.</li>
                    <li>Dr. Kalam was a great inspiration to many, especially kids, and always inspired them to dream big and achieve great goals in life.</li>
